/*
 * This is intended to run on an ATTiny85. Connect a 16.384 MHz crystal and fuse it
 * for divide-by-8 clocking, no watchdog or brown-out detector.
 *
 * Connect PB0 and PB1 to the coil pins of a Lavet stepper coil of a clock movement
 * (with a series resistor and flyback diode to ground on each pin) and power it 
 * from a 3.3 volt boost converter.
 *
 * It will keep a long-term average pulse rate of 1 Hz (alternating coil pins),
 * but will do so by alternating between ticking really fast and just stopping.
